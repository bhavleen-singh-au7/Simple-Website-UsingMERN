Learned decent amount of React topics, now I'm moving further taking my backend knowledge as well as FrontEnd knowledge and building a simple MERN stack website, which will be consisting of following pages:
- Home page 
- Signin Page
- Signup Page
- User Dashboard Page (which will be protected)
- A Navbar to switch between the routes
